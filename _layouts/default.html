                <p> I am a PhD candidate in Public Policy at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs. I research the role of civil society organizations in shaping public policies. My dissertation examines environmental nonprofits and their funding flows through three analytical lenses: network effects, nonprofit attributes, and grant-making dynamics. Prior to pursuing doctoral studies, my professional journey includes roles at the Urban Institute's Center on Nonprofits and Philanthropy, research positions at Texas A&M University, and contributions to the public sector through service with the U.S. Department of Energy. I am a proud first-generation college graduate and alumnus of Texas public schools.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>This study uses statewide survey data (n=114) and exponential random graph modeling (ERGM) to investigate the organizational and network factors impacting foundation grant-getting for environmental nonprofits in Texas. In line with elitism perspectives, we observe the likelihood of foundation grants going to those nonprofits who are already receiving financial grants (known in network analysis as preferential attachment). We also find that financial resources were a statistically significant predictor as the higher a nonprofit’s level of resources the more likely they are to receive a foundation grant. However, from a pluralist perspective, we also observe that local geography was meaningful since environmental nonprofits conducting work in areas with higher environmental risks were more likely to receive foundation funding. Our findings suggest that aspects of both elitism and pluralist environmental philanthropy are present in the Texas environmental funding landscape, and conventional frameworks for analyzing philanthropic funding patterns need to consider relational dynamics and context-specific funding nuances.</p>
